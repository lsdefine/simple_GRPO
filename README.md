# 🚀🚀🚀 simple_GRPO 🚀🚀🚀
A very simple GRPO implement for reproducing r1-like LLM thinking.
This is a simple open source implementation that utilizes the core loss calculation formula referenced from Hugging Face's trl. 
We make the simplest codebase to support: 
- Save the GPU memory to make a feasible and efficient training. 
- Quickly understand RL processes such as GRPO from a teaching perspective. 
- Quickly try a lot of things, such as improved multi-answer generation, regrouping, penalty on KL, and parameter tuning.
- "Aha moment" is observed during the early stages of model training.

## ✨NEW
- **2025/07/23: 🚀 Check out [LSRL](https://github.com/lsdefine/lsrl) - Our next-generation RL framework with custom optimizer and streamlined architecture for better performance!**
- 2025/02/19: Added a loss triton implementation, which has a little speedup, but you can choose not to use it. See *simple_grpo_v1* fold
- 2025/02/19: Added regroup version, implemented sampling of generated data on ref_server. See *regroup_ver* fold
- 2025/02/27: Added vllm package to accelerate the inference.
- 2025/03/24: Added reinforce++ algorithm.Usage is the same as before.

## 🌟 Features
### 💡 Simplicity
The project code is simple, with only about 200 lines of code spread across 2 files. It only depends on standard libraries such as _deepspeed_ and _torch_, without requiring dependencies like ray. It is designed to allow for more complex interventions.

### 🤖 Splited Reference Model
The reference model part is decoupled, which allows it to be run on different GPUs (even on a different machine with 4090). This avoids having the reference model and the training model on the same GPU, preventing multiple copies created by torch’s multiprocessing, and enabling training of a 7B model on 80G A800.

### 💃 Performance
Training completed in under 1 hour on 1*A800 GPUs. Both Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B exhibited an "Aha moment" within the first 30 optimization steps.

### 🥳 Core Loss Calculation
The loss calculation formula is based on Hugging Face's trl. We extend our gratitude to Hugging Face for their contribution.

## 🙌 Environment
The runtime environment is in the requirements.txt
so you can
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
At least two GPUs are needed.

## Usage
### Now, if you have three GPUs or more, you will have a better choice!!!
Run the following command:
``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 python ref_server.py
```
This just uses one GPU to collect and run the reference model.

In *grpo_vllm_one.py*, set the generation device index ​relative to the visible devices​ in next step:
``` bash
gen_device = 1
```
Then, open another bash:
``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3,4,5,6 deepspeed grpo_vllm_one.py
```
## ✨ Experimental Results

1. Runtime Environment
- Hardware Setup: 2×A800 (80GB) GPUs
- Configuration:
  - Training: 1 GPU with Zero-Stage 2 optimization
  - Inference: Dedicated 1 GPU (3090/4090 compatible)

2. Training Performance
   
| Model        | Steps | Time       |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| Qwen2.5-3B   | 60    | 12m 34s    |
| Qwen2.5-7B   | 60    | 16m 40s    |

- Accuracy:
  - Stabilizes above 60% after 5 optimization steps
  - Peaks at ~70%
- Format Compliance:
  - Reaches ≈100% after 30 steps

2.2 Qwen2.5-7B

- Accuracy:
  - Maintains >90% throughout training
- Format Compliance:
  - Achieves 100% within 30 steps
- Convergence: Both metrics show rapid convergence

## Aha Moment
1. Qwen2.5-3B (Step 20)
> `<think>`
> ...
> To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold,  we subtract the number of eggs painted by Arnold from the number of eggs painted by Camden. So, 21 - 28 = -7.  **However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem,
> as Camden cannot have painted fewer eggs than Arnold.
> Let's reconsider the initial solution steps:
> we should verify if the initial assumption about the relationship between Camden and Sarah's eggs is correct.**
> ...
> `</think>`
> `<answer>`-7`</answer>`

2. Qwen2.5-7B (Step 20)

> `<think>`
> ...
> Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.
> **However, this doesn't seem right because the total should be 500 and we've already accounted for 150,
> leaving room only for 350 from the average trees, which contradicts the total. Let's reassess.**
> ...
> `</think>`
> `<answer>`350`</answer>`
 
## 😊 TODO
- Answer generation may be invalid due to a group containing all wrong answers or all correct answers. We need group reorganization and better answer generation.
- GPU memory is still tight if it generates long cots. We have to split the groups to make the batch smaller.

We have implemented and are testing these features. They will be available soon.
